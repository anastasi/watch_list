## How do we build and run it? 
```
    git clone REPO_URL
    cd FOLDER_NAME
    npm install
    npm start
    Enjoy :)
```

## What tools did you use? Why did you use them? 
    - create-react-app library, for minimize problems with webpacks;
    - hooks for keeping function components and modern development; 
    - integration with API. I used fetch and async await for resolving promise;
    - styled components for css in js;
    - PropTypes for checking types;
    - Loading spining for UX

## Did you intentionally leave stuff out? In that case, what and why? 
    I didn't use any state managements like Redux because I don't think that we need it here. Because of we don't have to change or edit smth and we only have one page.
    I didn't use React Router either, for reducing extra clicks in the project. It is the best practice for UX design as well.
